# Shopify Dashboard Clone

## Overview
This project is a clone of the Shopify dashboard, aiming to create a responsive and accessible web application. The idea for this project originated from a hackathon participated in last year, where the goal was to replicate the core functionalities and user interface of Shopify's dashboard.

## Features
- Responsive design: The dashboard is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- Accessibility: Accessibility features have been implemented to ensure that the dashboard is usable by people with disabilities, following best practices and guidelines such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
- Core functionalities: The dashboard provides essential features found in the original Shopify dashboard, including order management, product inventory tracking, sales analytics, and customer management.
- User authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox and Grid for layout)
- JavaScript (for interactivity and dynamic content)
- Responsive design frameworks/libraries (e.g., Bootstrap)
- Accessibility libraries/plugins (e.g., ARIA attributes, screen reader testing tools)
- Version control system (e.g., Git)
- Hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify)

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Run a local server (e.g., using Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code) to view the project in your web browser.

## Usage
- Upon opening the dashboard, users can sign up or log in to access their account.
- Once logged in, users can navigate through different sections of the dashboard, such as orders, products, analytics, and customers.
- Users can perform actions such as creating/editing orders, managing product inventory, viewing sales data, and interacting with customer information.
- The dashboard provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to manage their online store efficiently.
