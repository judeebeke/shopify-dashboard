# Shopify Dashboard Clone

## Overview

## Features
- Responsive design: The dashboard is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox and Grid for layout)
- JavaScript (for interactivity and dynamic content)
- Responsive design frameworks/libraries (e.g., Bootstrap)
- Accessibility libraries/plugins (ARIA attributes, screen reader testing tools)
- Version control system (Git)
- Hosting platform (vercel)
